# tmux

This is my personal tmux configuration.

The config is designed to be simple but powerful, with plugins managed through [TPM](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) and sessions managed with [sesh](https://github.com/joshmedeski/sesh). It enables mouse support, sane defaults, and includes a minimal dotbar at the top for a clean UI.

## Installation and Setup

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You’ll need `tmux >= 3.3`, [TPM](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm), and [sesh](https://github.com/joshmedeski/sesh) installed for this config to work as expected.

Clone the repo into your tmux config folder, typically `~/.config`:

```bash 

git clone https://github.com/s4096770/tmux.git ~/.config/tmux 
```

Then start tmux and install plugins with:
`prefix + I`
(`prefix` by default is `ctrl+b`)

# Plugins
```bash
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tpm'              # Plugin manager
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-sensible'    # Sane defaults
set -g @plugin 'vaaleyard/tmux-dotbar'         # Minimal top bar
set -g @plugin 'alexwforsythe/tmux-which-key'  # Keymap hints
```
